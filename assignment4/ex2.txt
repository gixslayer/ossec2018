peter is (secret, application)
starts as (unclassified, application) due to weak tranquility, meaning security level can increase up to secret if needed (but not down again).

// i: read /usr/bin/someprog (unclassified, application)

allowed, as unclassified <= unclassified (no read-up), and application >= application (no read-down).
no changes.

// ii: read /usr/lib/somelib.so (unclassified, system)

allowed, as unclassified <= unclassified (no read-up), and system >= application (no read-down).
no changes.

// iii: read /home/peter/database (confidential, user)

confidential > unclassified, so this would fail with strong tranquility, but we can escalate the security level from unclassified to confidential (as unclassified < confidential <= secret).
not allowed, as confidential <= confidential (ok after escalation, no read-up), but user < application (not ok, as read-down).
no changes, assuming we do not actually perform the escalation as the Biba rule failed.

// iv: write socket (unclassified, untrusted)

allowed, as unclassified >= unclassified (no write-down), and untrusted <= application (no write-up).
no changes.

// v: read /etc/password (confidential, trusted)

confidential > unclassified, so this would fail with strong tranquility, but we can escalate the security level from unclassified to confidential (as unclassified < confidential <= secret).
after escalating it is allowed, as confidential <= confidential (no read-up), and trusted >= application (no read-down).
security level changes to confidential.

// vi: write /etc/shadow (top secret, trusted)

not allowed, as top secret >= confidential (ok, no write-down), but trusted > application (not ok, as write-up).
no changes.

2b)

write /home/peter/out.

Bell-LaPadula: no write-down so security level must be >= confidential.
Biba: no write-up so integrity level must be <= application.

so the following pairs are permitted:

(confidential, untrusted)
(confidential, user)
(confidential, application)
(secret, untrusted)
(secret, user)
(secret, application)
(top secret, untrusted)
(top secret, user)
(top secret, application)
